# SuperDebloater for Huawei P40 Pro

I've been using for months Huawei P40 Pro but I don't like some of the apps that has included Huawei in their firmwares so this is a clean.

## Usage (WIP)
Just launch the following command:

./launcher.sh <remove|restore> <debloat list>

It's required to have installed adb. By the moment only for UNIX systems. Can be used on windows after installing GIT and using GIT console.
